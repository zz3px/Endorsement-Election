# Endorsement-Election
In presidential primaries, endorsements have been among the best predictors of which candidates will succeed and which will fail. 

The   endorsement   dataset   gives   information   about   candidates’   campaign   performances   in   primary through   June   30th   from   each   year   in   1980   -   2012.   It   evaluates   109   candidates’   performances   in terms   of   their   weighted   endorsement   points,   percentage   of   weighted   endorsement   points,   money raised,   percentage   of   money   raised,   percentage   of   primary   vote   won   and   primary   result.

Questions   of   Interests:
1. The   team   is   interested   in   figuring   out   which   variables   are   especially   crucial   in   predicting
the   outcome   of   the   primary.   In   this   question,   the   team   will   adopt   the   logistic   regression   in order   to   get   the   predictors.

2. Building   on   to   the   model   established,   the   team   want   to   test   which   predictors   have stronger   weights   in   determining   the   outcome   of   the   primary.   Also,   the   team   will   examine closely   to   find   out   which   method   is   better   in   testing   the   model.
3. Lastly,   the   team   is   interested   in   predicting   the   probability   that   candidates   fall   into   two classes   of   the   binary   response   as   a   function   of   the   explanatory   variables.   In   order   to approach   that,   the   team   is   going   to   use   classification   methods,   Linear   Discriminant Analysis   (LDA),   Quadratic   Discriminant   Analysis   (QDA)   and   classification   tree   to predict   whether   a   candidate   will   win   the   primary   on   the   basis   of   their   previous performances.
