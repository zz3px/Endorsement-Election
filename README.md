# Endorsement-Election
In presidential primaries, endorsements have been among the best predictors of which candidates will succeed and which will fail. 
The   endorsement   dataset   gives   information   about   candidates’   campaign   performances   in   primary through   June   30th   from   each   year   in   1980   -   2012.   It   evaluates   109   candidates’   performances   in terms   of   their   weighted   endorsement   points,   percentage   of   weighted   endorsement   points,   money raised,   percentage   of   money   raised,   percentage   of   primary   vote   won   and   primary   result.
